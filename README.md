# Women in HPC Workshop Formal Mentoring Program

As part of the poster program for the Women in HPC workshop at ISC, we have organized a formal mentoring program.
Each poster presenter is matched with a volunteer mentor from the WHPC community.
Much of the information contained in this document is taken from an invaluable resource:
[*Adviser, Teacher, Role Model, Friend: On Being a Mentor to Students in Science and Engineering* (1997)](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/5789/adviser-teacher-role-model-friend-on-being-a-mentor-to).

> In general, an effective mentoring relationship is characterized by mutual respect, trust, understanding, and empathy. Good mentors are able to share life experiences and wisdom, as well as technical expertise. They are good listeners, good observers, and good problem-solvers. They make an effort to know, accept, and respect the goals and interests of a student. In the end, they establish an environment in which the student's accomplishment is limited only by the extent of his or her talent.

This repo consists of 2 documents:
1. A [mentee guide](https://github.com/womeninhpc/mentoring/blob/master/mentee-guide.md) for those receiving mentoring.
2. A [mentor guide](https://github.com/womeninhpc/mentoring/blob/master/mentor-guide.md) for those giving mentoring.
