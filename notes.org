   set varBody to "Hello " & varMenteeName & ", I would like to introduce you to your mentor, " & varMentorName & ".

I hope you are both excited for <<event>> and the WHPC workshop (about 6 weeks away)! I hope that you are both able to connect at least 3 times between now and the workshop. Please use email, video chat, slack direct-messages or whatever works best. Not every mentor will be able to attend <<event>> and/or the WHPC workshop, but hopefully you can prep for the conference together.

I've created some documents about mentoring that you can find here: https://github.com/womeninhpc/mentoring

In addition to working on your lightning talk and a general elevator pitch of your work, I've shared topics you indicated interest in discussing below.

Please let me know if you have any questions!
