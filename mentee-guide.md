# Guide for Mentees

## Mentoring Pairs

Mentor pairs are assigned in April and consist of 1 community volunteer (the mentor) and 1 poster presenter (the mentees).
These matches are assigned based on the responses from the matching surveys.
While we do our best to match based on mutual interests, if you find that you and your mentor aren’t compatible, please raise this with the mentoring team (Elsa/Mozhgan).
Our goal is not to force you to stay with the mentor you were assigned to, but rather that you have a positive mentoring experience.
Even if you and your assigned mentor are a good match, we encourage you to talk with others for a variety of perspectives and expertise.

## Mentoring Activities

Before ISC, we ask that mentoring pairs communicate 2-3 times over email, video chat, slack direct-message, or other means.

During ISC, we encourage the mentors and mentees to attend several events:
- The WHPC evening reception, usually on Wednesday
- The WHPC workshop, usually on Thursday
- The ISC poster session on Tuesday and Wednesday (though additional registration may be required)

After ISC, the formal mentoring relationship is over.
We encourage mentees and mentors to keep in touch, but it is not required.

## Common Questions

### Why should I participate?

- Gain access to a new network of contacts
- Get a broader diversity of perspectives than your own advisor or department
- Learn from someone else’s experiences
- Obtain help in achieving your goals
- Improve your self-confidence

### What can I do to get the most out of mentoring?

- Keep in touch with your mentor before, during, and after the Summer School.
  You may not have burning questions at all times, but reaching out to your mentor will help you establish a good relationship with them.
- Ask your mentor any questions you may have -- don’t hold back!
  Even if your mentor doesn’t have the answer, he or she can help you find another mentor in our community who can answer your question.
- Feel free to disagree with your mentor, question your mentor, or ask for clarification.
  They can only assess how helpful they are if you give feedback.
- Your mentor is there to help you to think through your options and help you to formulate your plans.
  You make the decisions and you take the responsibility.
- Always seek mentoring in a public space.
- Reach out beyond your assigned mentor.
  Getting a variety of opinions from multiple mentors is a great idea.
- Talk to the mentoring team (Scott/Weronika) if you are not happy with your mentoring group.

### What should I avoid?

- Assuming that because technical areas differ, your mentor’s advice is not applicable.
- Assuming that your mentor cannot possibly understand your situation.
  Give them a chance -- you might be surprised!
- Assuming your mentoring match will be perfect.
  No match is perfect and your mentor may only be able to help you with some of your issues, this does not mean that the partnership will not work.
  Discuss your aims and goals; find out the strengths of your mentor and the areas in which your mentor feels able to assist.

### What should I talk about with my mentor?

You will have many opportunities to talk to your mentor and fellow mentees, and the better prepared you are the more you will benefit from them.
You should spend some time thinking what it is that you want to talk with your mentor about.

Things you may want to talk about include:
- How to organise your time and responsibilities;
  How to achieve a work-life balance
- Personal and professional challenges -- how to make the best out of them
- What to expect from working in the industry/academia/government/etc.
- How to adapt to working in an international setting or another country
- How to find funding;
  How to get access to HPC resources
- Different working arrangements -- What is it like to work from home/work remotely?
- Professional etiquette
- How to talk to people;
  How to effectively build your network
- How to deal with people issues at work (e.g., problems with your advisor, manager, confrontations, etc.)
- How to succeed in a job interview
